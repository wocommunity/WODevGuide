    <b>Search</b>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Search page allows you to search for movies based on 3 criteria: 
        <i>title</i>, 
        <i>category</i>, and 
        <i>date released</i>.   These three criteria are implicitly 'AND'ed 
        together to create one query.  Therefore, a search for Title='R' and Category='Drama' 
        would search for movies with the Title beginning with 'R' AND Category equal to 'Drama'.</p>
      Both the 
      <i>title</i>
      and 
      <i>category</i>
      attributes are queried case insensitive.

    <b>Master Index</b>
    <blockquote> The Master Index button performs a query of the database returning all movies. </blockquote>
    <a name = "ADD"></a>
    <b>Add</b>
    <blockquote>
      The Add page allows you to add a movie to the database.  However, it does not allow 
      you to create relationships to actors and directors.
    </blockquote>
    <a name = "VOTING"></a>
    <b>Voting</b>
    <blockquote>
      While viewing a movie, a voting average is displayed.  The voting average characterizes 
      the viewer's rating of the movie based on a scale of zero through ten; Ten being an 
      excellent movie and zero being a very poor movie.
    </blockquote>
    <a name = "REVIEWS"></a>
    <b>Reviews</b>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        While viewing a movie, a link to its reviews will be displayed.  Click on this link to 
        see the reviews made of this movie.  If you would like to add a review, click on the link 
        'Add a New Review'.
      </p>
      <p>
        If no reviews exist, then no links will be displayed below the text 'Click a link to 
        select that review'.  When reviews do exist, clicking on these links brings up the review 
        written by that reviewer.
